# Road Network Analysis in Federal Territory of Putrajaya
>Tools: Python, OSMnx, NetworkX

## Why analyzing Putrajaya's road network?
In early 2001, the **Federal Administrative Centre of Malaysia** were **relocated** from Kuala Lumpur **to Putrajaya** due to **congestion** issue.
- In the early planning of Putrajaya, an efficient transportation system was emphasized to connect facilities, services, and workplaces.
- The **goal** was to create a **congestion-free** city with public transport-oriented design (Ho Chin Siong, 2006).
- Therefore, understanding the effectiveness and structure of the road network is essential.
- This study conducts a road network analysis to **evaluate** how well **Putrajaya’s network supports its intended goals**.

## Objectives
1. To **construct** the **road network** of Putrajaya, limited to **driveways**, using OpenStreetMap data.
2. To **identify influential nodes** within Putrajaya through road network analysis, focusing on:
- Degree
- Closeness Centrality
- Betweenness Centrality
3. To **identify** the **shortest path** between **influential nodes** within the study area.

## Scope of Study

This study focused on [Putrajaya](http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html?q=putrajaya) roads limited to **driveways** only.

## Methodology

## Findings
- Python OSMnx, Python NetworkX and OpenStreetMap data are essential for constructing the road network.
- Closeness centrality concentrated in the central area of Putrajaya.
- Betweenness centrality is uniformly distributed throughout Putrajaya.
- Strategis routes lies on Lebuh Perdana Barat, Persiaran Sultan Sallahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah and Lebuh Perdana Timur.
